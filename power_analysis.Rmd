$H_0$: $µ_t = µ_c$ - There is no significant difference in the average survey quizlet results before the control and the treatment groups. 

$H_a$: $µ_t \neq µ_c$

Using a two-tailed test:

```{r sample size}
pwr.t.test(sig.level = 0.05,
           alternative = "two.sided",
           power = 0.80,
           d = .5)
```
